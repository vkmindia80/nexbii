### 2. ‚úÖ Customer Analytics Dashboard - Fixed 400 Error
**Status:** COMPLETED

**Root Cause:**
The demo database (`demo_database.db`) existed but was empty (0 bytes). When the dashboard tried to execute queries against this database, it failed with "no such table" errors, which the API wrapped in a 400 Bad Request response.

**What was done:**
- Executed the existing `/app/backend/create_demo_db.py` script to populate the database
- Created realistic demo data including:
  - 25 products across multiple categories
  - 200 customers with segments (Enterprise, SMB, Startup, Individual)
  - 1,500 orders with order items
  - 5,000 user activity records

**Database Details:**
- Location: `/app/backend/demo_database.db`
- Size: 1.8 MB
- Tables: products, customers, orders, order_items, user_activities

**Verification:**
- Tested query execution by query_id: ‚úÖ Working
- Tested Customer Analytics Dashboard queries: ‚úÖ Working
- All 3 demo dashboards now load and display data correctly:
  - Demo: Sales Analytics Dashboard
  - Demo: Customer Analytics Dashboard
  - Demo: Operational Metrics Dashboard
