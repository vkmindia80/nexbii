## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **Mock Mode Only**
   - Emails are logged but not sent (MOCK_EMAIL=true)
   - Slack messages are logged but not sent (MOCK_SLACK=true)
   - **Solution:** Set environment variables to false for production

2. **No Real-Time Updates**
   - Activity feed doesn't auto-refresh
   - Comments don't update live
   - **Solution:** Manual page refresh or implement WebSockets

3. **No Alert History UI**
   - Alert history exists in backend
   - No frontend component to display history yet
   - **Solution:** Add history modal in future enhancement

4. **Limited Error Handling**
   - Some edge cases may not have user-friendly errors
   - **Solution:** Add comprehensive error messages

### Workarounds

**For Real Email Testing:**
```bash
# In backend/.env
MOCK_EMAIL=false
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
```

**For Real Slack Testing:**
```bash
# In backend/.env
MOCK_SLACK=false

# Then use real Slack webhook URL in alert form
```
