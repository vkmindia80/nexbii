## ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step Action Plan (Next 48 Hours)**

### **Phase 1: Pre-Deployment Verification (2 hours)**

**1. Verify All Services Running:**
```bash
# Check service status
sudo supervisorctl status

# Expected output:
# backend                          RUNNING   pid 123
# frontend                         RUNNING   pid 456
```

**2. Test Backend Health:**
```bash
# Backend health check
curl http://localhost:8001/api/health

# Expected: {"status":"healthy"}
```

**3. Test Demo Login:**
```bash
# Test authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:8001/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=admin@nexbii.demo&password=demo123"

# Expected: JSON with access_token
```

**4. Verify Frontend:**
```bash
# Check frontend is accessible
curl http://localhost:3000

# Should return HTML
```

### **Phase 2: Production Configuration (3-4 hours)**

**1. Environment Variables:**

Edit `/app/backend/.env`:
```bash
# Production database (or keep SQLite demo)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/nexbii_prod

# MongoDB (if using)
MONGO_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/nexbii

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0

# Email (or keep MOCK_MODE=true initially)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM=noreply@yourdomain.com

# Frontend URL for emails
FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# JWT Secret (generate new one)
SECRET_KEY=your-new-secret-key-here
```

Edit `/app/frontend/.env`:
```bash
# Backend API URL
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com

# Or if same domain:
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
```

**2. Security Checklist:**
- [ ] Generate new JWT SECRET_KEY for production
- [ ] Set up SSL/TLS certificates
- [ ] Configure CORS allowed origins in backend
- [ ] Review and restrict API rate limits
- [ ] Set up database backups

**3. Optional Integrations:**

git clone your-repo-url /app

# 3. Install dependencies
cd /app/backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
cd /app/frontend && yarn install

# 4. Start services
sudo supervisorctl start all

# 5. Set up reverse proxy (Nginx example)
# Configure Nginx to proxy:
# - Port 80/443 -> Frontend (3000)
# - /api -> Backend (8001)
```

**Option B: Cloud Platforms**
- AWS: Use Elastic Beanstalk or ECS
- Google Cloud: Use App Engine or Cloud Run

# Use docker-compose to orchestrate all services
docker-compose up -d
```

### **Phase 4: Post-Deployment (1-2 hours)**

**1. Smoke Testing:**
- [ ] Access your production URL
- [ ] Login with demo credentials
- [ ] Generate demo data
- [ ] Create a test data source
